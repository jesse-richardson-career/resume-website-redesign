  <h2>About This Site</h2>
  <p>This is where the magic happens. I appreciate websites with clean designs, minimal information with maximum clarity, and a bit of style to make things pop.</p>
  <p>This site was made with those ideas in mind. I built this website from scratch using Angular, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS/SASS, as well as tools like GitHub, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome. In creating this site, I used responsive design principles, so it doesn't just look nice on wide screens, but on mobile phones as well, and everything in between.</p>
